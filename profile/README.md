## 💡 Overview  

**MKVToolNix** is a professional-grade toolkit for working with *Matroska (MKV)* video files, offering precise control over multiplexing, demultiplexing, and editing of video, audio, and subtitle tracks. It’s widely used by video editors, encoders, and digital archivists who need a flexible, high-performance solution for managing media containers.  

With its intuitive **MKVToolNix GUI**, users can merge, split, extract, and modify video files with ease. The tool supports a wide variety of input formats — including MP4, AVI, FLV, MOV, and MPEG — enabling powerful cross-format editing and conversion to MKV.  

Unlike typical video editors, **MKVToolNix** focuses on maintaining original quality while allowing complete control over metadata, chapters, and stream synchronization. Whether you’re adjusting audio delays, embedding subtitles, or reordering tracks, it performs each operation with exceptional precision and speed.  

The app is optimized for macOS, providing a native, fast-performing interface with full support for Apple Silicon chips. Its modular structure also allows advanced users to use command-line tools like `mkvmerge`, `mkvinfo`, and `mkvextract` for automation or large-scale batch processing.  

From professional editing workflows to everyday media management, **MKVToolNix** delivers a reliable, open-source solution for mastering Matroska videos without compromising performance or quality.
